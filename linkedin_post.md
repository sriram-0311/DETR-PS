# LinkedIn Post for DETR-PS Project

## Main Post Content:

ðŸš—ðŸ¤– **Excited to share my latest project: DETR-PS - Automotive Panoptic Segmentation with Detection Transformers!**

I've been working on implementing a cutting-edge **Detection Transformer (DETR)** architecture for panoptic segmentation specifically designed for autonomous driving scenarios. This project combines my passion for computer vision and automotive AI! ðŸ”¥

ðŸŽ¯ **What makes this special:**
âœ… End-to-end transformer architecture - no NMS required!
âœ… Unified framework for both instance & semantic segmentation
âœ… Multi-camera support with temporal consistency
âœ… Production-ready inference pipeline
âœ… Comprehensive evaluation with Panoptic Quality metrics

ðŸ”§ **Technical Highlights:**
â€¢ ResNet50 backbone with feature pyramid networks
â€¢ 6-layer transformer encoder/decoder with self-attention
â€¢ Hungarian matching for optimal prediction assignment
â€¢ Advanced mask merging and post-processing algorithms
â€¢ Integration with Cityscapes & Waymo datasets

ðŸ“Š **Results that matter:**
â€¢ 65.2 PQ on Cityscapes dataset
â€¢ 15 FPS inference speed for real-time applications
â€¢ 34 semantic classes including vehicles, pedestrians, infrastructure

This project showcases my expertise in:
#ComputerVision #DeepLearning #Transformers #AutonomousDriving #MachineLearning #PyTorch #AI

The complete implementation is open-source and available on GitHub with comprehensive documentation, training scripts, and evaluation metrics.
